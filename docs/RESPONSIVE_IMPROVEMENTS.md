#### Typography Scaling
- **Author name**: `14px → 16px` (sm → base)
- **Meta text**: `12px → 14px` (xs → sm)
- **Timestamps**: Responsive hiding of separators on small screens

### 4. Related Posts Component (`related-posts.tsx`)

#### Grid Responsiveness
- **Mobile**: Single column for easy scrolling
- **Small tablets**: Two columns for better content consumption
- **Large screens**: Three columns for comprehensive related content display

#### Enhanced Interactions
- Smooth hover animations with device-appropriate transforms
- Progressive image scaling on hover
- Optimized transition durations for different device types

### 5. Pagination Component (`pagination.tsx`)

#### Touch-Friendly Design
- **Button sizing**: `32px → 40px` (mobile → desktop)
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 44px on mobile devices
- **Spacing**: Tighter spacing on mobile, generous on desktop
- **Typography**: `14px → 16px` for better readability

## Custom CSS Utilities

### Responsive Text Classes
```css
.text-responsive-xs { /* 12px → 14px → 16px */ }
.text-responsive-sm { /* 14px → 16px → 18px */ }
.text-responsive-base { /* 16px → 18px → 20px */ }
```

### Enhanced Line Clamping
- Cross-browser compatible line clamping utilities
- Responsive line counts based on screen size
- Fallback support for older browsers

### Touch-Friendly Utilities
```css
.touch-target {
  min-height: 44px; /* Mobile: 48px */
  min-width: 44px;
}
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Chrome-specific transform optimizations
- `will-change` properties for smooth animations
